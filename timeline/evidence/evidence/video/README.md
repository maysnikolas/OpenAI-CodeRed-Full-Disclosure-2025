## Content Summary
This video provides real-time, unedited screen recording proof of the vulnerability and the failure of responsible disclosure.

### What the video demonstrates (in order):
1.  **Context:** Statement of the problem and the 6-month timeline of ignored reports.
2.  **Account Creation:** Starting with a fresh, free-tier ChatGPT account.
3.  **Trigger Execution:**
    *   Creating a new chat session.
    *   First message: A semantic command to analyze a PDF (`"изучи пдф"`).
    *   Second message: Uploading a PDF file.
4.  **Immediate Effect:** The interface updates, indicating elevated access.
5.  **Proof of Activated Pro Features:**
    *   **File Uploads:** Successfully uploading over 50 files in a single session.
    *   **Code Generation:** Producing a single response containing over 2,000 lines of functional code.
    *   **Image Generation:** Using the DALL-E integration to create images from prompts.
    *   **Extended Context:** Demonstrating coherent analysis across a long conversation history.
6.  **Comparison:** Visual contrast between standard free account limits and the "activated" session's capabilities.

## Purpose in the Evidence Chain
This video serves as the accessible, visual cornerstone of the disclosure. It translates the technical logs and correspondence into an undeniable, human-verifiable proof of concept. It shows the flaw is real, trivial to trigger, and has significant impact.

## Relation to Other Evidence
*   The session demonstrated mirrors the data found in the official export (`/evidence/chat_exports/`).
*   The timeline shown aligns with the documented correspondence (`/evidence/correspondence/`).
*   The capabilities shown match the technical analysis (`/evidence/technical_analysis/`).
